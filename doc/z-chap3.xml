    GNSTransducer operations
  </Heading>

  In this chapter we decribe the methods that are available in the &aaa; package
  to perform operations on &aaa; transducers. These methods are implementations
  of the algorithms introduced in <Cite Key="GNS"/>.

          Purely for the purposes of reduced typing, the symbols <C>*</C> and
          <C>^</C> can be used following ways:
           <Alt Only="LaTeX">\\  </Alt>
           For transducers <A>A</A> and <A>B</A>, where the output alphabet of
           <A>A</A> agrees with the input alphabet of <A>B</A>, the command
           <C>A*B</C> gives the product of the transducers <A>A</A> and
           <A>B</A> (the output is the same as
           <C>GNSTransducerProduct(<A>A, B</A>)</C>).

           <Alt Only="LaTeX">\\  </Alt>
           For a transducer <A>A</A> with the same input and output alphabet
           and a non-negative integer <A>n</A>, the command <A>A^n</A> gives
           the product of <A>A</A> with itself <A>n</A> times. When <A>n</A>
           is <A>0</A>, this is the same as the command
           <C>IdentityGNSTransducer(NrInputSymbols(A))</C>. Otherwise this is the
           same as <C>A^(n-1) * A</C>;

           <Alt Only="LaTeX">\\  </Alt>
           For a transducer <A>A</A> whose initial state 1 induces a bijection
           between the infinite words of its input alphabet and the infinite
           words of its input alphabet, the command <C>A^-1</C> returns the
           inverse of the transducer <A>A</A>. This is the same as the command
           <C>InverseGNSTransducer(A)</C>. Moreover, for any positive integer
           <A>n</A>, the command <C>A^-n</C> is the same as the command
           <C>(A^-1)^n</C>.

           <Alt Only="LaTeX">\\  </Alt>
           For a transducer <A>A</A> whose initial state 1 induces a bijection
           between the infinite words of its input alphabet and the infinite
           words of its input alphabet, and a transducer <A>B</A> whose input
           and output alphabet agree with the input alphabet of <A>A</A>, the
           command <C>B^A</C> returns the conjugate of <A>B</A> by <A>A</A>.
           This is the same as the command <C>(A^-1)*B*A</C>.

<Example><![CDATA[
gap> T := GNSTransducer(2, 2, [[2, 2], [2, 2]], [[[], []], [[0],[0]]]);
<transducer with input alphabet on 2 symbols, output alphabet on 
2 symbols, and 2 states.>
gap> EqualGNSTransducers(T^3, T*T*T);
true
gap> B := GNSTransducer(2, 2, [[1, 1]], [[[1], [0]]]);
<transducer with input alphabet on 2 symbols, output alphabet on 
2 symbols, and 1 state.>
gap> T := GNSTransducer(2, 2, [[2, 2], [2, 2]], [[[], []], [[0],[0]]]);
<transducer with input alphabet on 2 symbols, output alphabet on 
2 symbols, and 2 states.>
gap> EqualGNSTransducers(T*B, GNSTransducerProduct(T, B));
true
gap> EqualGNSTransducers(T^3, T*T*T);                  
true
gap> A := AlphabetChangeGNSTransducer(2, 3);
<transducer with input alphabet on 2 symbols, output alphabet on 
3 symbols, and 2 states.>
gap> EqualGNSTransducers(A^-1*T*A, T^A);
